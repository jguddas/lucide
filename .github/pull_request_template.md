### I have thought of everything <!-- ONLY for new icons, remove this part if not icon PR -->

- [ ] Icon has a valid use case.
- [ ] Provided a meta JSON file in `icons/[iconName].json`
- [ ] Elements have at least 1 pixel padding within the canvas.
- [ ] Icons are visually centered.
- [ ] Icons have a similar optical volume as `circle` and `square`.
- [ ] Icons have similar visual density and level of detail.
- [ ] Icons are fun and playful.
- [ ] Elements and Arcs centers align with the grid.
- [ ] Corners have a 2px radius or have a good reason for sharpness.
- [ ] Holes and gaps only become invisible with stroke widths of at least 4px.
- [ ] Gaps are closed, so they are 2px when possible.
- [ ] Curves join smoothly.

### I have optimized everything <!-- ONLY for new icons, remove this part if not icon PR -->

> If you don't know how to optimize, don't worry, we will help you and keep this list unchecked

- [ ] Arc path segments are used in place of curves when possible.
- [ ] `circle` and `rect` are used instead of `path` when possible.
- [ ] `path` is used instead of `polyline`, `line` and `polygon`.
- [ ] Paths only contain one move segment.
- [ ] Dots use `M{{x}} {{y}}h0.01`.
