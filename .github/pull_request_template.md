## Icon Design Checklist <!-- ONLY for new icons, remove this part if not icon PR -->

#### Naming <!-- ONLY for new icons -->

- [ ] Icons are named in lowercase and use dashes instead of spaces, for example, `arrow-up` instead of `Arrow Up` and do not end with a number like -2, -3, -4, etc.
- [ ] Icons are named by what they are rather than their use case, for example save should rather be named to floppy-disk.
- [ ] Icons that are part of a group are named group-type so, for example, badge-plus is based on badge.
- [ ] Provided a meta JSON file in `icons/[iconName].json`.

#### Design <!-- ONLY for new icons -->

- [ ] Elements have at least 1 pixel padding within the canvas.
- [ ] Icons are visually centered.
- [ ] Icons have a similar optical volume as `circle` and `square`.
- [ ] Icons have similar visual density and level of detail.
- [ ] Icons are fun and playful.
- [ ] Elements and Arcs centers align with the grid.
- [ ] Corners have a 2px radius or have a good reason for sharpness.
- [ ] Holes and gaps only become invisible with stroke widths of at least 4px.
- [ ] Gaps are closed, so they are 2px when possible.
- [ ] Icons are sharp on low dpi displays.
